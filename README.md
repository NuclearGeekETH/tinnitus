## Tinnitus Treatment with Python

# tool to create reversing phase tone to try to help with tinnitus

The idea here is to create an audio file that plays a reversing phase tone that attempts to cancel out the tone you hear from tinnitus symptoms

I have no idea if this has any scientific merit but the symptoms of tinnitus can be so intense that I am willing to try anything.

The thought is to utilize the same principle as destructive noise cancellation but in reality this does not cause destructive noise cancellation
because tinnitus is not a physical noise but a sensation. However, in my testing this has shown to provide me some relief even if that is anecdotal evidence.

If you want to try it out here is my process:

Step 1: Find a tone that matches your tinnitus on a website like this: [Tone Generator](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/).

Step 2: Edit line 5 of tinnitus.py with your frequency you found in step 1.

Step 3: Run test_tone.wav using higher end headphones to see if this helps. 

I found 18500 Hz as my sweet spot for symptomatic relief. For me, when my symptoms are intense, I will play this file on a loop and it seems to cause
some relief. I keep it stored on my mobile and play it over earbuds. It really helps me most at night when trying to fall asleep.
